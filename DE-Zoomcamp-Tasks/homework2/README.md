#### Q2: What is the rendered value of the variable `file`?
**Answer:** `green_tripdata_2020-04.csv`

**Explanation:**  
The variable `file` is defined in a templated context (e.g., in a workflow like Prefect or Jinja). When rendered using `render(vars.file)`, it resolves to the filename `green_tripdata_2020-04.csv`, which is then used in subsequent steps.
